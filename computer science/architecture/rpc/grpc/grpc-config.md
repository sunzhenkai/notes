# 配置格式

```json
{
  // Load balancing policy name.
  // Currently, the only selectable client-side policy provided with gRPC
  // is 'round_robin', but third parties may add their own policies.
  // This field is optional; if unset, the default behavior is to pick
  // the first available backend.
  // If the policy name is set via the client API, that value overrides
  // the value specified here.
  //
  // Note that if the resolver returns at least one balancer address (as
  // opposed to backend addresses), gRPC will use grpclb (see
  // https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/load-balancing.md),
  // regardless of what LB policy is requested either here or via the
  // client API.
  'loadBalancingPolicy': string,

  // Per-method configuration.  Optional.
  'methodConfig': [
    {
      // The names of the methods to which this method config applies. There
      // must be at least one name. Each name entry must be unique across the
      // entire service config. If the 'method' field is empty, then this
      // method config specifies the defaults for all methods for the specified
      // service.
      //
      // For example, let's say that the service config contains the following
      // method config entries:
      //
      // 'methodConfig': [
      //   { 'name': [ { 'service': 'MyService' } ] ... },
      //   { 'name': [ { 'service': 'MyService', 'method': 'Foo' } ] ... }
      // ]
      //
      // For a request for MyService/Foo, we will use the second entry, because
      // it exactly matches the service and method name.
      // For a request for MyService/Bar, we will use the first entry, because
      // it provides the default for all methods of MyService.
      'name': [
        {
          // RPC service name.  Required.
          // If using gRPC with protobuf as the IDL, then this will be of
          // the form "pkg.service_name", where "pkg" is the package name
          // defined in the proto file.

      // is a transient failure connecting to the server. Otherwise, gRPC will
      // attempt to connect until the deadline is exceeded.
      //
      // The value specified via the gRPC client API will override the value
      // set here. However, note that setting the value in the client API will
      // also affect transient errors encountered during name resolution,

      // is obtained by the gRPC client via name resolution.

      // be overridden in code. If no reply is received in the specified amount
      // of time, the request is aborted and a deadline-exceeded error status
      // is returned to the caller.
      //
      // The actual deadline used will be the minimum of the value specified
      // here and the value set by the application via the gRPC client API.
      // If either one is not set, then the other will be used.
      // If neither is set, then the request has no deadline.

      // will not be sent and the client will see an error.
